            <h4>Life in General Coach</h4>
            <p><strong>Life in the General Coach of Indian Railways:</strong> A Raw, Unfiltered Experience.</p>
            <p>Indian Railways is often called the "lifeline of the nation," and nowhere is this more evident than in the General (Unreserved) Coach‚Äîa world of its own, filled with chaos, camaraderie, and countless untold stories.</p>
            <p>For millions of daily passengers, the General Coach is not just a mode of transport; it‚Äôs a microcosm of India itself‚Äîvibrant, crowded, unpredictable, and yet strangely welcoming.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What Makes the General Coach Unique?</strong></p>
            <img src="images/generalcoach.webp" alt="Post 1">
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1. The Ultimate Test of Survival Skills:</strong> No reserved seats, no guaranteed space‚Äîjust pure adaptability. Passengers rush in like a tidal wave. If you‚Äôre lucky, you get a seat. If not, be ready to stand, squat, or hang from the doors.</li>
              <li><strong>2. The Most Diverse Crowd You‚Äôll Ever Meet:</strong> Daily wage workers, students, families, vendors, pilgrims. Conversations range from politics to cricket to life stories. It‚Äôs a place where strangers become friends.</li>
              <li><strong>3. The Battle for Space:</strong> "Yeh seat khali hai?" is the most common question. People sleep on luggage racks, squeeze between seats. Vendors shouting ‚ÄúChai! Samosa!‚Äù add to the symphony.</li>
              <img src="images/genralcoachrail.webp" alt="Post 1">
              <li><strong>4. Food & Survival Tactics:</strong> Platform food is life. Sharing snacks is common. The toilet challenge? Real.</li>
              <li><strong>5. The Unwritten Rules:</strong> "Adjust kar lo" is the golden rule. Beware of thieves. Night journeys turn into communal sleepovers.</li>
            </ul>
